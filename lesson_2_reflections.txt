Question 1:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Thoughts:
Initializes empty Git repository in the directory. Because the step is allowing further files tracking and Git commit.

Question 2:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Thoughts:
The different from the working directory is the staging area has added the files for commit.  While the different from the repository is the staging area has the logical changes before commit. The value the staging area offers is that the logical changes are ready for commit or are able to be removed.

Question 3:
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Thoughts:
I will ensure all the files with the the logical change and complete changes to be added into the staging area before the commit.

Question 4:
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Thoughts:
Some situations are to keep the unofficial changes in git repository but not in master. Branches help to keep the unofficial changes for future mmerge into master when the changes becomes official.

Question 5:
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Thoughts:
The diagrams help to show the the commits a branch can or can't reach, and the commits not belonging to any branch.

Question 6:
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Thoughts:
The result is the changes of the two branches are merged into one commit. Because the way shows the relationship between commits and the branches.

Question 7:
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Thoughts:
Pros: Automatic merging does fast, while always doing merges manually ensures correct merge result
Cons: Automatic merging may cause wrong merge result, and can't deal with conflict. While always doing merges manually is slow.
