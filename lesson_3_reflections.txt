Question 1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Thoughts:
When I am working on a repository with a team memebers  coordinately.

Question 2:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Thoughts:
Because I want to ensure my changes won't be automatically overwritten by the changes from remote repository.
