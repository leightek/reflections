Question 1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Thoughts:
When I am working on a repository with a team memebers  coordinately.

Question 2:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Thoughts:
Because I want to ensure my changes won't be automatically overwritten by the changes from remote repository.

Question 3:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Thoughts:
Fork is to keep a copy in GitHub server, clone is to keep a local copy, while branch is to keep the files in different location but same repository for version control.
I use Fork for the repository without change permission, use the clone to copy other repository, and use branch to control file version.

Question 4:
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Thoughts:
The benefit is to know the comparison remote base for collaboration.

Question 5:
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Thoughts:
File sharing would be easier. Version control would be harder.

Question 6:
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Thoughts:
When the changes are not official. Separate branch approach has the benefits to keep changes for future use, which master approach has the benefits to share the changes.
